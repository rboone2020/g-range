README

These parameter files are those that accompany version 1.15 of G-Range.  Many supporting files and the folder structure are provided through the G-Range web page ( www2.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/grange/index.php ).  But the parameters used by a particular version of G-Range may include edits to their structures that make them version-specific.  That said, there are no known structural differences between the parameters supporting version 1.13 and version 1.15.

Note that these parameter files are provided to inform users of the structures recognized and expected by G-Range.  Users are encouraged to alter the values of parameters themselves to tune simulation performance.  Changes that alter the structure of the parameter files will likely cause G-Range to fail.
